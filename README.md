# 🚀 Docker Control API

Docker Control API is a lightweight API server for managing and updating Docker containers. Built with TypeScript and powered by the Elysia framework, it offers streamlined container orchestration for simple, self-hosted environments.

> Pull, restart, and rollback Docker services via HTTP API.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Update and rollback containers with image version tracking
- 🔃 Update GitHub commit status to reflect deployment result
- 🔐 API key authentication for secure requests
- (Planned) Implement Rolling deployment
- (Planned) Better API-Key Encryption
- (Planned) Use Github APP to set Github statuses

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Docker
- Node.js (for development)

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/junglesub/docker-ctrl-api.git
cd docker-ctrl-api

# Install dependencies
bun install
```

## 🌐 Environment Variables

The following environment variable is required for optional GitHub integration:

- `GITHUB_SECRET` — used to authenticate and update commit statuses on GitHub

### Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file with your service definitions and API keys:

```yaml
keys:
  myApp:
    container_name: test_feed
    secret_key: abc123
```

This path defaults to `./config.yml` but can be overridden by setting the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

## 🚀 Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Update Container

**POST** `/update?id=myApp`

#### Headers

- `x-api-key`: Your API key

### Query

- `id`: Key in `config.yml` file.

#### Body

```json
{
  "gh": {
    "commitSha": "your-commit-sha",
    "githubRepo": "owner/repo"
  }
}
```

#### Response

- Success: `"ok"`
- Failure: HTTP error status with message

## 🐳 Docker Support

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./config.yml:/app/config.yml -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ghcr.io/junglesub/docker-ctrl-api:latest
```

> Ensure the container has access to the Docker socket:
> `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

## 🔁 GitHub Actions

CI/CD is integrated via GitHub Actions. A push to the `main` branch triggers a Docker image build and push to GitHub Container Registry.

## 🧪 Testing

Test scenarios are defined in the `.bruno` directory. Use [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) to send and validate requests.

## 🛡 Security

- API key authentication
- Service name validation to prevent command injection
- No full Docker control exposure — only deployment actions
